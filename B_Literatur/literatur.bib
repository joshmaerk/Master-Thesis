Research in work organizations has tended to take the perspectives of either the employees (i.e., their well-being) or the owners (i.e., their profits). SDT provides the concepts that guide the creation of policies, practices, and environments that promote both wellness and high-quality performance. We examine the relations of SDT to transformational leadership, job characteristics, justice, and compensation approaches.},

Central to leadership is the ability to support, motivate, and engage followers – that is, the capacity to have influence. Mindfulness has been proposed as a valuable enabler of effective leadership influence. In this study, we synthesize a growing body of research on mindfulness in leadership contexts by reviewing how and under what conditions mindful leaders influence their followers. We meta-analysed two associations: leaders’ mindfulness and leadership behaviours directed towards followers; and leaders’ mindfulness and follower outcomes (i.e., well-being, performance and leader–follower relations). Based on a pool of 109 studies with 396 effect sizes and 19,887 participants, we found that leaders with higher mindfulness engage in more follower-centred leadership behaviours, such as more transformational and authentic leadership (r = 0.39 [0.22, 0.54]), and as a result have better relations with followers (r = 0.33 [0.25, 0.40]), and have followers with better well-being (r = 0.33 [0.25, 0.41]) and performance (r = 0.35 [0.29, 0.41]). Longitudinal and emerging intervention evidence corroborates this pattern of findings. Key contributions of this review are critically evaluating the quality of existing studies and outlining a research agenda to advance this field.},

	abstract = {Self-determination theory proposes a multidimensional conceptualization of motivation comprising autonomous and controlled forms. Whereas autonomous motivation relates positively to individuals’ optimal functioning (e.g., well-being, performance), controlled motivation is less beneficial. To be able to use self-determination theory in the field of organizational behaviour, the Multidimensional Work Motivation Scale was developed and tested using data from 3435 workers in seven languages and nine countries. Factorial analyses indicated that the 19-item scale has the same factor structure across the seven languages. Convergent and discriminant validity tests across the countries also indicate that the psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness as well as the theoretically derived antecedents to work motivation (e.g., leadership and job design) are predictably related to the different forms of motivation, which in turn are predictably related to important work outcomes (e.g., well-being, commitment, performance, and turnover intentions). Implications for the development of organizational research based on self-determination theory are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},

            Teams that combine human intelligence with artificial intelligence (AI) have become indispensable for solving complex tasks in various decision‐making contexts in modern organizations. However, the factors that contribute to AI convergence, where human team members align their decisions with those of their AI counterparts, still remain unclear. This study integrates signaling theory with self‐determination theory to investigate how specific signals—such as signal fit, optional AI advice, and signal set congruence—affect employees' AI convergence in human–AI teams. Based on four experimental studies conducted in facial recognition and hiring contexts with approximately 1100 participants, the findings highlight the significant positive impact of congruent signals from both human and AI team members on AI convergence. Moreover, providing an option for employees to solicit AI advice also enhances AI convergence; when AI signals are chosen by employees rather than forced upon them, participants are more likely to accept AI advice. This research advances knowledge on human–AI teaming by (1) expanding signaling theory into the human–AI team context; (2) developing a deeper understanding of AI convergence and its drivers in human–AI teams; (3) providing actionable insights for designing teams and tasks to optimize decision‐making in high‐stakes, uncertain environments; and (4) introducing facial recognition as an innovative context for human–AI teaming.},

Since spring 2023, the JRC has developed and deployed GPT@JRC, a platform providing safe and compliant access to state-of-the-art Large Language Models for over 10,000 knowledge workers. While the literature highlighting the potential of GenAI to enhance productivity for knowledge-intensive tasks is abundant, there is a scarcity of empirical evidence on impactful use case types and success factors. This study addresses this gap and proposes the JRC GenAI Compass conceptual framework based on the lessons learnt from the JRC’s GenAI adoption journey. It includes the concept of AI-IQ, which reflects the complexity of a given GenAI system. This paper thus draws on a case study of enterprise-scale AI implementation in European public institutions to provide approaches to harness GenAI’s potential while mitigating the risks.},

This study aimed to explore how employees can positively respond and adapt to digital transformation and the uncertainty it creates. Based on the job demands–resources (JD-R) theory, we propose that perceived technology uncertainty may be a type of job demand which will increase employees’ technostress and, sequentially, reduce job satisfaction. Moreover, we argue that two factors, coproduction work context and individual skill flexibility, should be included as additional demands and resources that jointly interact and influence employees’ wellbeing. We explore our theoretical arguments in the financial services industry context, where the Fintech Revolution is undergoing. Data from a two-wave survey of 296 employees revealed that perceived technology uncertainty indeed threatens employees’ subjective wellbeing through increased technostress. However, we found complex interactions among these three factors. While coproduction was originally an intensive job demand, it becomes a job resource to help employees cope with technostress if they have high skill flexibility. If employees can flexibly use their skills to face digital revolution challenges, the experiences acquired from coproduction jobs will be valuable for future work. Managerial implications were also discussed, along with directions for future research.},

But new research shows that it can have a downside: a study of over 3,500 people found that using AI tools led to performance gains, but also made employees less motivated and more bored when they had to work on other tasks, without the use of AI. The researchers examine their findings to offer ways that leaders can redesign workflows and preserve the elements of work that drive intrinsic motivation. By doing so, companies can unlock the full potential of both AI and their workforce.},

	abstract = {Evidence on AI acceptance comes from a diverse field comprising public opinion research and largely experimental studies from various disciplines. Differing theoretical approaches in this research, however, imply heterogeneous ways of studying AI acceptance. The present paper provides a framework for systematizing different uses. It identifies three families of theoretical perspectives informing research on AI acceptance—user acceptance, delegation acceptance, and societal adoption acceptance. These models differ in scope, each has elements specific to them, and the connotation of technology acceptance thus changes when shifting perspective. The discussion points to a need for combining the three perspectives as they have all become relevant for AI. A combined approach serves to systematically relate findings from different studies. And as AI systems affect people in different constellations and no single perspective can accommodate them all, building blocks from several perspectives are needed to comprehensively study how AI is perceived in society.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a significant part of digital transformation that signifies new requirements for middle managers in AI-integrated work contexts. This is particularly evident in financial service industries. Given the significance and rapidity of this technological transition, this case study investigated how middle managers perceived the impacts of AI system integration on their work characteristics. Interview data were gathered from 25 middle managers of a company providing financial services. The data were analyzed using the Gioia method. The findings showed that the AI systems applied in the case company were perceived as technical tools (mechanical AI) or coworkers (thinking AI and feeling AI), which had different impacts on middle managers’ work characteristics and the relationship between humans and AI systems. The middle managers’ work characteristics included contextual, task, competence, social, and relationship characteristics. Regarding the relationship characteristics, this study shows theoretically distinct human–AI relationship types. The findings are organized into a conceptual framework. AI system integration in service teams is a complex phenomenon that makes middle managers’ work more demanding and requires balancing and managing multiple challenges and dialectical tensions. The findings inform the selection and training of managers according to changing work characteristics in the digital age.},

However, in practice, the introduction of AI tools often fails to meet these expectations and results in negative consequences, such as worker resistance and dissatisfaction. Yet we have little understanding of the process of how and why initially positive design intentions of AI tools result in negative consequences. Building on a qualitative in-depth case study of a Chinese firm introducing an AI tool in sales, we found that whereas the AI tool's initial design seemingly intended to lead to salespeople's empowerment and first achieved respective outcomes, over time the tool was appropriated for managerial control. We show that this devolution emerged organically from a growing managerial awareness of the affordances that the AI tool offered managers to perform their work better. Our study contributes to the literature on AI by highlighting the potential dangers of AI tools and emphasizing the importance of including workers in the AI tool's design and implementation phases.},

	abstract = {This paper is the first to examine the impact of robotization on work meaningfulness, autonomy, competence, and relatedness, which are essential to motivation and well-being at work. Using surveys of workers and robotization data for 14 industries in 20 European countries spanning 2005–2021, we find a consistent negative impact of robotization on perceived work meaningfulness and autonomy. Using instrumental variables, we find that doubling robotization leads to a 0.9 \% decrease in work meaningfulness and a 1 \% decline in autonomy. To put this in perspective, if the robotization levels of the top 5 industry were to match those of the leading industry in terms of robot adoption in 2020 (equivalent to a 7.5-fold increase), it would result in a decline of 6.8 \% in work meaningfulness and 7.5 \% in autonomy. The link between robotization, competence, and relatedness is also negative but less robust. We also examine how tasks, skills, and socio-demographic characteristics moderate the main relationships. We find that workers with routine tasks experience an even greater negative effect of robotization in terms of declines in their autonomy, competence, and relatedness. However, we also discover that utilizing computers as tools for independent work can help workers maintain a sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in industries and job roles that adopt robots. Our results highlight that by deteriorating work meaningfulness and self-determination, robotization can impact work life above and beyond its consequences for employment and wages.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation elicits new management challenges. Studies have investigated its direct impact on employee behavior, but how employees evaluate enterprise digital capability, and its underlying mechanism remains unknown. Employees’ evaluations of enterprise digital capability tend to shape their subsequent attitudinal and behavioral responses towards the digital transformation, which may ultimately stress influence on the overall transformation initiative in a “bottom-up” manner. Drawing from work design theory and conservation of resources theory, this study proposes that through the implementation of effective work design strategies, organizations can foster a sense of employee impact, and further construes a mediated moderation model regarding how the relationship between employee impact and their evaluation of enterprise digital capability is moderated by empowering leadership, and further, mediated by cognitive adjustment at work. Empirical results based on a three-wave survey featuring 424 full-time Chinese employees show that: employee impact predicts evaluation of enterprise digital capability, and such linkage is not only enhanced by empowering leadership but also strengthened by cognitive adjustment at work. The moderation effect of empowering leadership in the relationship between impact and digital capability evaluation is further mediated by cognitive adjustment at work. We explore the antecedents and mechanisms of differences in employees’ evaluation of enterprise digital capability and propose takeaway managerial messages.},

However, preceding studies on digital transformation still have the problem of “seeing things but not people”, ignoring factors at the employee level, which makes the impact of digital transformation on employee resilience remains a subject of debate and investigation. Based on the job-demands resources theory and regulatory focus theory, this study explores the double-edged sword nature of digital transformation by constructing a dual-path model, and examines its potential to both enable and burden employees’ resilience. Through the analysis of a 3-wave multisource data from employees in different cities in China (N = 432), the dual-path model between digital transformation and employee resilience was supported. That is, the mediating effect of thriving at work and job insecurity were confirmed. In addition, the moderating effect of both promotion focus and prevention focus were proved, respectively. From a human-centric perspective, the present study theoretically expands the research of digital transformation in the context of organization. In the meanwhile, this study offers practical insights for organizations seeking to maximize the benefits of digital transformation while minimizing its potential negative consequences on employee resilience.},

The paper then introduces the more flexible JD-R model and discusses its basic premises. Findings: The paper provides an overview of the studies that have been conducted with the JD-R model. It discusses evidence for each of the model's main propositions. The JD-R model can be used as a tool for human resource management. A two-stage approach can highlight the strengths and weaknesses of individuals, work groups, departments, and organizations at large. Originality/value: This paper challenges existing stress models, and focuses on both negative and positive indicators of employee well being. In addition, it outlines how the JD-R model can be applied to a wide range of occupations, and be used to improve employee well being and performance.

Proponents of the technology extol its benefits for enhancing efficiency and productivity, while others voice concerns about the potential harm to human workers. To provide greater clarity on this pressing issue, this article presents a systematic review of empirical research that sheds light on the implications of AI use at work. Organized under five inductively generated themes within a multilevel framework, we uncover individual, group, and organizational factors that shape the interplay between humans and AI. Specifically, the themes are: (1) human–AI collaboration; (2) perceptions of algorithmic and human capabilities; (3) worker attitudes towards AI; (4) AI as a control mechanism in algorithmic management of platform-based work; and (5) labor market implications of AI use. Our review offers insights into these themes and identifies five pathways for future research. Finally, we provide practical recommendations for organizational leaders seeking to implement AI technologies while prioritizing their employees' well-being.},

              Algorithmic HR systems are becoming a more prevalent interface between organizations and employees. Yet little research has examined how automated HR processes impact employee motivation. In a three‐wave study (
              N
              Time1
               = 401;
              N

              N
              Time3
               = 303), we investigated the motivational effects of HR systems that automatically capture—and make decisions based on—employee performance, and whether these effects depend on employee attributions regarding the organization's intended use of its automated HR metric system. Additionally, we test whether these motivational states affect employee task prioritization and emotional exhaustion. Results show that employees whose organizations use algorithmic HR systems, and who also attribute managerial control as intent to that system, experience higher levels of extrinsic motivation at work. This, in turn, predicts greater prioritization of metricized tasks and de‐prioritization of non‐metricized tasks. Conversely, employees who believe the purpose of algorithmic HR systems is to provide them with constructive feedback are more likely to experience intrinsic motivation, leading to reduced feelings of emotional exhaustion, greater prioritization of metricized tasks, but reduced non‐metricized behavior de‐prioritization. These results illustrate the critical importance of employee sensemaking around algorithmic HR systems as a precursor to the impact of such systems on employee motivation, behavior, and well‐being.},

At the organizational level of analysis, the study found that firm performance was associated with more uniform levels of downward strategic influence, and more varied levels of upward influence among middle management cohorts. The findings suggest that middle managers’ strategic influence arises from their ability to mediate between internal and external selection environments. In addition, positive effects on organizational performance appear to depend on: (1) whether the overall pattern of upward influence is conducive to shifts in the network centrality of individual managers; and (2) whether the pattern of downward influence is consistent with an appropriate balance between the organization’s need for control and flexibility.},

Emerging evidence shows that presenteeism can be a choice that offers a range of positive benefits to the ‘presentee’ (an employee who works through illness). In this conceptual article, we view presenteeism as purposeful and adaptive behaviour: a dynamic process that serves the purpose of balancing health constraints and performance demands in tandem. We propose a 2×2 framework of presenteeism (therapeutic, functional, overachieving, and dysfunctional) and suggest that the success of the presenteeism adaptation process depends on the availability of internal capacities and flexible work resources. When the workplace is supportive and provides adequate resources to aid adaptation, presenteeism can be a sustainable choice for maintaining performance under impaired health. We examine the role of resources for functional presenteeism by drawing on conservation of resources theory and self-determination theory. This framework can contribute to a better understanding of presenteeism by viewing it as an adaptive process, considering presentees as heterogeneous groups, and exploring the importance of internal and work resources for balancing health and performance demands. It sketches new avenues for research and practice and the effective management of presenteeism, health, and performance.},

We identified 55 heterogeneous work redesign intervention studies, of which 39 reported a positive effect on performance, two reported a negative effect, and 14 reported mixed effects. Of five types of work redesign, the evidence that work characteristics can explain the effect of redesign interventions on performance was most promising for relational interventions, and participative and non-participative job enrichment and enlargement. Autonomous work group and system-wide interventions showed initial evidence. As to ‘why’ work redesigns enhance performance, we identified change in work motivation, quick response and learning as three core mechanisms. As to ‘when’, we showed that intervention implementation, intervention context (including alignment of organizational systems, processes and the work redesign) and person factors are key boundary conditions. We synthesize our findings into an integrative multilevel model that can be used to design, implement and evaluate work redesigns aimed at improving performance.},

On the other hand, employees may develop a negative perception of AI feedback once it is disclosed to them, thus harming their productivity (“disclosure effect”). We examine these two effects theoretically and test them empirically using data from a field experiment. We find strong evidence that both effects coexist, and that the adverse disclosure effect is mitigated by employees' tenure in the firm.

            Management practice is informed by fundamental assumptions about human motivation. We review two contrasting perspectives: agency theory – which assumes that humans are self‐interested rational beings whose actions should be constrained to achieve organizational goals (which are opposing) – and self‐determination theory – which assumes that individuals will thrive when they have autonomy to pursue activities and can internalize external goals when their needs are satisfied. We highlight how the assumptions of agency theory continue to dominate the design and implementation of management practices and management education, despite decades of evidence that individuals are not solely driven by economic rationality. We suggest that attempts to refine these assumptions have so far fallen short of adequately representing human motivation and highlight an important aspect of self‐determination theory which is often neglected from these debates: how people come to internalize goals. Placing motivation internalization as more central to management thinking yields practices that more effectively align the interests of employees and organizations.},

Researchers have applied self-determination theory to identify key motivational correlates of these adaptive work-related determinants and outcomes. Research applying the theory has consistently indicated that autonomous forms of motivation and basic psychological need satisfaction are related to better employee performance, satisfaction, and engagement, while controlled forms of motivation and need frustration are associated with increased employee burnout and turnover. Forms of motivation have also been shown to mediate relations between need satisfaction and adaptive workplace outcomes. Despite support for these associations, a number of limitations in research in the field have been identified, which place limits on the inferences that can be drawn. Noted limitations encompass an over-reliance on single-occasion, correlational data; few fit-for-purpose tests of theory mechanisms; and a lack of consideration of key moderating variables. In the current conceptual review, we discuss these limitations in turn, with specific reference to examples from the extant research applying the theory in workplace contexts, and provide a series of recommendations we expect will set the agenda for future studies applying the theory in the workplace. Based on our review, we make three key recommendations: we stress the need for studies adopting experimental and longitudinal designs to permit better inferences (i.e., causal and directional), highlight the need for intervention research to explicitly test mediation effects to provide evidence for theory mechanisms, and outline some candidate moderators of theory effects, including workplace context, job type, pay structure, and causality orientations. We expect these recommendations to set an agenda for future research applying self-determination theory in workplace contexts with a view to filling the current evidence gaps and improving evidential quality.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The present study aimed to examine the relationship between humble leadership (HL) and employee adaptive performance by testing the mediating role of self-determination and the moderating role of employee attributions of HL.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              A three-wave, two-source design was used to collect quantitative data from 301 employees and 45 direct supervisors of mainland Chinese enterprises. Testing the hypotheses was conducted through multiple regression analysis and moderated regression analysis.
            
            
              Findings
              Results showed that HL was positively related to employee adaptive performance. Additionally, the relationship between HL and employee adaptive performance was mediated by self-determination. Furthermore, this positive effect of HL on self-determination was minimized among employees who attribute HL to impression management motives but is insignificant for employees who attribute HL to performance improvement motives.
            
            
              Originality/value
              It has been widely concerned that the traditional “top-down” leadership styles are associated with employee adaptive performance; however, the role of bottom-up leadership styles on employee adaptive performance has only been sporadically examined. The present study introduced HL, a typical bottom-up leadership style and developed a moderated mediation model to investigate the potential effect of HL on employee adaptive performance. Moreover, by confirming the mediating role of self-determination, the authors further uncover how HL facilitates employees' adaptive performance. Meanwhile, the moderating role of employee attributions of HL found in this study offers new insights into the understanding of the effectiveness of HL.},

The final 20-item scale assesses workers' perceived level of exposure to algorithmic: monitoring, goal setting, scheduling, performance rating, and compensation. These dimensions formed a higher order construct assessing overall exposure to algorithmic management, which was found to be, as expected, negatively related to the work characteristics of job autonomy and job complexity and, indirectly, to work engagement. Supplementary analyses revealed that perceptions of exposure to AM reflect the objective presence of AM dimensions beyond individual variations in exposure. Overall, the results suggest the suitability of the AMQ to assess workers' perceived exposure to algorithmic management, which paves the way for further research on the impacts of these rapidly accelerating systems.},

Yet, “true” leadership—that is, motivating and enabling people so that they can and will contribute to the collective goals of an organization—is still predominantly viewed as the prerogative of humans. With our opinion piece, we challenge this perspective. Our essay aims to be a wake-up call for large parts of academia and practice that romanticize human leadership and think that this bastion can never be overtaken by AI. We delineate why algorithms will not (need to) come to a halt before core characteristics of leadership and potentially cater better to employees’ psychological needs than human leaders. Against this background, conscious choices need to be made about what role humans are to play in the future of leadership. These considerations hold significant implications for the future of not only leadership research but also leadership education and development.},

            Cognitive evaluation theory, which explains the effects of extrinsic motivators on intrinsic motivation, received some initial attention in the organizational literature. However, the simple dichotomy between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation made the theory difficult to apply to work settings. Differentiating extrinsic motivation into types that differ in their degree of autonomy led to self‐determination theory, which has received widespread attention in the education, health care, and sport domains. This article describes self‐determination theory as a theory of work motivation and shows its relevance to theories of organizational behavior. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

            In this systematic review, we present a comprehensive overview of the temporal person environment (PE) fit literature. To this end, we organize and integrate extant temporal fit research and discuss research trends and developments in the temporal domain. Our analysis reveals that temporal conceptualizations of fit vary in terms of change process (transitional, developmental, transformational), level of aggregation (situational vs. baseline level), and temporal frame (clock time vs. psychological time), all of which divide the temporal fit literature in significant ways. Furthermore, our analysis shows that progress in the temporal fit domain has been confined by five major obstacles: An emphasis on selection and socialization processes, a narrow focus on the between‐person level of analysis, preoccupation with linear change, a strong interest in normal causation questions, and a lack of attention to misfit. We conclude with a discussion of the research challenges that lie ahead and provide suggestions to tackle these challenges and expand temporal PE fit research in new directions.},

            Implementing successful organizational change is challenging, and to better understand it, researchers and practitioners have proposed a variety of models of change management. Paradoxically, while the behavior change of organizational members lies at the core of organizational change, theories and models of behavior change are rarely applied to organizational change management. Such knowledge could improve our understanding of underlying psychological mechanisms behind organizational change adoption and maintenance. Using self‐determination theory as the framework, we developed a model of organizational change that integrates knowledge across the organizational and behavior change fields by (i) unifying change practices derived from organizational change models and from behavior change techniques, (ii) identifying and unifying underlying psychological mechanisms derived from theories that explain how organizational and behavior change occurs, and (iii) linking change practices to psychological mechanisms. The resulting model aims to provide theoretical and practical guidance for those involved in the planning and implementation of organizational change.},

            Gig workers have become an important component of the contemporary workforce and have generated extensive interest among researchers. The purpose of this article is to provide an integrative review of the literature on gig workers. Consistent with the more recent studies, we adopt a broad definition of gig work, which is characterized by the temporary nature of the work, project‐based compensation, work flexibility, and non‐membership in an organization. We first discuss the major themes in the literature based on an input–process–output framework. Specifically, we review what factors drive individuals to engage in gig work, how gig work impacts gig workers based on four theoretical approaches, and what outcomes individuals experience as a result of engaging in gig work. Based on the literature review, we highlight six future research agendas. We also discuss practical implications for gig workers, traditional organizations, digital labor platforms, and society.},

Results from two studies—a survey study with 259 leader–subordinate dyads and an experimental study with 174 part‐time master's‐level students—largely supported our theoretical model. First, employees develop harmonious passion when they perceive the presence of a mastery climate, but develop obsessive passion when they perceive the presence of a performance climate. Second, harmonious passion mediates the positive effect of mastery climate on employees' proactive work behavior, whereas obsessive passion mediates the positive effect of performance climate on employees' pro‐job unethical behavior.

Organizational dehumanization (OD), defined as employees' perceptions of being treated as mere tools by their organization, has been shown to negatively affect employees and organizations. To explain such detrimental effects, scholars have argued that OD might thwart employees' fundamental psychological needs. Yet, evidence of this mechanism remains empirically nonexistent. Filling this gap, this research aims at investigating the mediating role of psychological need thwarting in the relationships between OD and employees' well-being and attitudes. Based on a cross-sectional study ( N = 340) and a two-wave study (3 months apart; N = 603), the results indicate that OD thwarts employees' psychological needs which are, in turn, negatively related to their well-being (psychological strains, absenteeism, and job satisfaction) and attitudes (turnover intentions and affective commitment).},

            Organizations use project teams to lower search costs associated with locating expertise by assembling requisite expertise within a single unit. But prior research suggests that availability of expertise in teams does not guarantee its use. When are team members more likely to reach out to their peers for their expertise? To answer this question, this paper develops a theoretical model predicting dyadic expertise use in teams based on the opportunity–ability–motivation framework of behavior in organizations. We argue that 3 complementary conditions influence dyadic expertise use in teams: A focal team member is more likely to use a peer's expertise in a specific domain when the peer is perceived to have valuable expertise (opportunity), when the member is psychologically empowered (motivation), and when the member shares a strong tie with the peer (ability). We tested our framework using a 2‐wave dataset consisting of 1,898 observations of dyadic domain‐specific peer expertise use based on 71 members rating 166 peers nested within 22 teams. Findings suggest that tie strength and psychological empowerment jointly moderate the relationship between perceived peer expertise level and peer expertise use.},

            Work‐contingent self‐esteem (WCSE; the degree to which workers' self‐esteem is based on workplace performance) has positive consequences for performance, yet less is known about its consequences for well‐being. In this paper, we contribute to the literature on WCSE by examining the mechanisms through which it impacts well‐being at work and outside of work. We challenge contingent self‐esteem (CSE) theory (Crocker \& Park, 2004), which argues that CSE negatively impacts well‐being by fostering internally controlled (introjected) motivation and diminishing autonomous motivation, by suggesting that WCSE fosters autonomous and internally controlled motivation and thus has both beneficial and harmful effects on well‐being. We also expand CSE theory by suggesting that WCSE can negatively impact well‐being outcomes by causing work–nonwork conflict. Results from a time‐separated design in a sample of full‐time employees supported our arguments, revealing that WCSE impacted well‐being at work through both autonomous and internally controlled work motivations. WCSE also had negative effects on well‐being at and outside of work through work–nonwork conflict. The beneficial effects of WCSE outweighed its harmful effects on job satisfaction and neutralized its harmful effects for all other outcomes. We discuss theoretical implications for CSE theory, self‐determination theory, and work–nonwork issues and note important practical implications.},

            Research on leadership and creativity is dominated by the study of leadership from people in formal leadership positions. The very nature of creativity requires self‐direction, however. This points to shared leadership, a process in which members dynamically share the leadership role, as a particularly relevant influence to consider. Drawing on psychological empowerment theory, we develop the shared leadership perspective on individual creativity. We argue that shared leadership has a cross‐level influence on individual creativity that is mediated by the experience of meaning of work and moderated by individual differences in power distance value: for individuals lower on power distance, shared leadership has a positive linear relationship with individual creativity; for individuals higher on power distance, shared leadership has a curvilinear relationship with individual creativity that is decreasingly positive. Using a sample of 623 members from 95 teams in 34 Chinese organizations, we find support for this multilevel model. Findings offer theoretical implications for shared leadership and creativity research and provide managerial implications.},

	abstract = {Summary
            Proactive behavior (self‐initiated and future‐oriented actions to bring about change) has largely positive consequences for organizationally oriented outcomes such as job performance. Yet the outcomes of proactivity from a well‐being perspective have not been clearly considered. Drawing on self‐determination theory and the stressor‐detachment model, we propose two distinct paths by which proactivity affects individuals' daily well‐being. The first path is an energy‐generating pathway in which daily proactive behavior enhances end‐of‐work‐day vitality via perceived competence. The second is a strain pathway in which daily proactive behavior generates anxiety at work, which undermines the process of detachment from work. We argue that these pathways are shaped by the extent to which supervisors are prone to blaming employees for their mistakes (punitive supervision). We tested this model using a sample of 94 employees who completed surveys three times a day for between 5 and 7 days. Our multilevel analyses provide support for the proposed dual‐pathway model and suggest differential well‐being outcomes of daily proactive work behavior. Overall, when an individual behaves proactively at work, they are more likely to experience higher levels of daily perceived competence and vitality. However, these positive effects can exist in parallel with daily negative effects on end‐of‐workday anxiety, and hence bedtime detachment, but only when the supervisor is perceived to be punitive about mistakes.},

            Pro‐customer rule breaking refers to employees' breaking of organizational rules with the primary intention of helping customers or providing better customer service. In spite of its prosocial nature, it is unclear whether and how pro‐customer rule breaking also benefits employees who engage in this behavior. Drawing on self‐determination theory, we examine employees' well‐being and voice at work as outcomes of pro‐customer rule breaking. Across a simulation study and a critical incident‐based survey study, we found that pro‐customer rule breaking was positively related to employee psychological need fulfillment, which, in turn, was associated with lower emotional exhaustion, higher job satisfaction, and increased voice. Furthermore, normative conflict with organizational rule moderated the positive relationship between pro‐customer rule breaking and psychological need fulfillment such that employees with high normative conflict with organizational rule (i.e., employee perception that their existing organizational rule results in inefficiency and that their organization could be much better if it changed its practices) benefited more from their pro‐customer rule breaking. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings and offer directions for future research.},

We broadly review the literature on basic psychological need satisfaction at work with three more specific aims: to test SDT’s requirement that each basic psychological need should uniquely predict psychological growth, internalization, and well-being; to test whether use of an overall need satisfaction measure is appropriate; and to test whether the scale used to assess basic psychological needs influenced our results. To this end, we conducted a meta-analytic review of 99 studies with 119 distinct samples examining the antecedents and consequences of basic need satisfaction. We conclude with recommendations for addressing issues arising from our review and also identify points for future research, including the study of need frustration and culture, integrating the basic needs with other motivation theories, and a caution regarding the measures and methods used.},

	abstract = {Self-determination theory (SDT) is widely used in human resource (HR) practice studies to explain how HR practices impact work outcomes. However, there is little empirical evidence establishing the complete SDT mediational process in the HR domain, which entails basic psychological needs and motivation acting as mediators of relations between HR practices and work outcomes. The present study addresses this issue with a mixed methods approach. Using an item classification task with subject matter experts (N = 48), HR practices were classified as autonomy-, competence-, and relatedness-supportive. Based on this scheme, we tested an SDT-based conceptual model in a three-wave sample of working adults (N = 818). Results from Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling (MSEM) support the hypothesized model: basic psychological need satisfaction and autonomous motivation mediate the relationship between HR practice perceptions and work outcomes (performance, thriving, affective organizational commitment, and turnover intentions). Autonomy-supportive practices had a positive effect on autonomy need satisfaction, while competence-supportive practices had positive associations with all three basic psychological needs. Counterintuitively, relatedness-supportive practices had negative effects on autonomy and competence need satisfaction, and the relationship between relatedness-supportive practices and autonomy need satisfaction was moderated by chronological age. We discuss our findings in the context of prominent HR studies that utilize SDT and offer a supplemental age-inclusive HR practice scheme for HR managers interested in understanding the benefits of supporting basic psychological needs from both a motivation and workforce retention standpoint.},

This is based on close personal ties between supervisors and subordinates initiated outside the workplace. Drawing on conservation of resources theory, we develop a model that explains how supervisor–subordinate guanxi constitutes a social resource that spills over into the workplace and impacts subordinates’ job resources (including autonomy, support and development at work), job crafting (proactive behaviors aimed at increasing resources and reducing demands) and job performance (task performance and organizational citizenship behavior). Our model was tested on a sample of 406 subordinates and their supervisors from seven manufacturing organizations in China. The results of a multilevel path analysis indicate that high-quality guanxi relations with supervisors facilitate subordinates’ job resources, job crafting behaviors and organizational citizenship behavior at work. In addition, job resources mediate the relationship between supervisor–subordinate guanxi and job crafting, and job crafting mediates the relationship between supervisor–subordinate guanxi and subordinate task performance and organizational citizenship behavior. Overall, our research highlights the importance of externally-generated guanxi between subordinates and supervisors and the mechanisms that contribute to improving employee performance in the workplace.},

            Rapid growth in the gig economy has been facilitated by the increased use of algorithmic management (AM) in online platforms (OPs) coordinating gig work. There has been a concomitant increase in scholarship related to AM across scientific domains (e.g., computer science, engineering, operations management, management, sociology, and law). However, this literature is fragmented with scholars disagreeing on the conceptualization and measurement of AM, as well as a lack of consensus on the dimensions of AM influencing various gig worker‐related outcomes, the mechanisms through which these influences are exerted, and the relevant boundary conditions. To address these issues, we systematically reviewed the academic literature across scientific disciplines related to the AM of gig workers using natural language processing (NLP)‐based topic modeling. Our analysis yielded 12 topics, which we integrate using an input‐process‐output (IPO) framework to illustrate differing effects of AM on worker‐related outcomes. Based on our findings, we provide a comprehensive definition of AM, including its key dimensions, and highlight main mediating pathways through which the individual dimensions of AM impact various gig worker‐related outcomes. Finally, we provide a roadmap for future research on AM in the gig economy (GE) using an organizational behavior lens.},

            Little research to date has focused on understanding employee motivation to share and hide knowledge. Using self‐determination theory, we tested the premise that knowledge sharing and hiding might be differentially motivated and that work design characteristics might influence the motivation to share knowledge with colleagues. In a panel survey of Australian knowledge workers and in a Chinese knowledge‐intensive organization, we asked knowledge workers, using time‐lagged designs, about perceptions of work design, motivation to share knowledge, and self‐reported knowledge sharing and hiding behaviors. Results, largely replicated across both samples, indicated that cognitive job demands and job autonomy were positively related to future reports of knowledge‐sharing frequency and usefulness via autonomous motivation to share knowledge. Unexpectedly, task interdependence was positively related to the three forms of knowledge hiding (evasive and rationalized hiding, and playing dumb) via external regulation to share knowledge. Implications for the design of jobs that motivate knowledge sharing and demotivate knowledge hiding are discussed.},

We tested the hypotheses at both the between-person and within-person levels and found convergent results. Autonomous motivation mediated the positive relationship between authenticity and task performance/work proactivity, and supportive leadership was found to positively predict authenticity.

            With rising use of artificial intelligence (AI) in organizations, alongside increasing mental health issues, we seek to understand how AI use affects human stress. Drawing on the automation–augmentation perspective, we propose that AI control over decision‐making thwarts human autonomy and thus contributes to stress. Drawing on models of teamwork and augmentation, we expect that human–AI team processes (i.e., transition, action, and interpersonal processes) help people meet their goals and reduce stress. Finally, we argue that human–AI team processes provide an important social resource, which buffers the stress‐enhancing role of AI control. To test our hypotheses, we analyzed over 2700 tweets. Using a trained large language model, validated against human ratings, we indexed key measures. Results confirm that high AI control was associated with increased stress, whereas human–AI team processes were associated with decreased stress. In support of the moderation hypothesis, two human–AI team processes (action and interpersonal) helped further reduce the stress‐enhancing effect of AI control. We discuss implications for work design theory and the importance of regulating levels of AI control to protect workers' mental health.},
