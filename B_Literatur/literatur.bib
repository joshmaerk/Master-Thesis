  abstract = {The The integration of Self-Determination Theory and Artificial Intelligence in facilitating employee engagement in job performance within the banking sector in Karnataka was explored. SDT states that three innate psychological needs are at the center of developing intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction, which is stated as autonomy, competence, and relatedness. When AI tools are designed to meet these needs, organizations can create a more supportive and motivating work environment. Examples are personalized experiences provided by AI in task management systems that better help employees manage their work, real-time feedback to develop employee skills, and collaboration platforms that enhance connections among team members. The outcome can be increased employee engagement and job satisfaction to enhance overall performance. It offers some practical insights into how AI can be used to respond to the recent challenges that emerge with regard to employee engagement within an increasingly fast-moving banking environment and further opines that there is a need to balance technology approaches with human-centered approaches. This will be quite useful for the HR manager and the organizational leader in driving motivation, productivity, and job satisfaction through AI.},

The paper then introduces the more flexible JD-R model and discusses its basic premises. Findings: The paper provides an overview of the studies that have been conducted with the JD-R model. It discusses evidence for each of the model's main propositions. The JD-R model can be used as a tool for human resource management. A two-stage approach can highlight the strengths and weaknesses of individuals, work groups, departments, and organizations at large. Originality/value: This paper challenges existing stress models, and focuses on both negative and positive indicators of employee well being. In addition, it outlines how the JD-R model can be applied to a wide range of occupations, and be used to improve employee well being and performance.

  abstract = {The rising use of artificially intelligent (AI) technologies, including generative AI tools, in organizations is undeniable. As these systems become increasingly integrated into organizational practices and processes, understanding their impact on workers' experiences and job designs is critical. However, the ongoing discourse surrounding AI use in the workplace remains divided. Proponents of the technology extol its benefits for enhancing efficiency and productivity, while others voice concerns about the potential harm to human workers. To provide greater clarity on this pressing issue, this article presents a systematic review of empirical research that sheds light on the implications of AI use at work. Organized under five inductively generated themes within a multilevel framework, we uncover individual, group, and organizational factors that shape the interplay between humans and AI. Specifically, the themes are: (1) human--AI collaboration; (2) perceptions of algorithmic and human capabilities; (3) worker attitudes towards AI; (4) AI as a control mechanism in algorithmic management of platform-based work; and (5) labor market implications of AI use. Our review offers insights into these themes and identifies five pathways for future research. Finally, we provide practical recommendations for organizational leaders seeking to implement AI technologies while prioritizing their employees' well-being.},

While AI systems enhance organizational performance, thereby catching the attention of the decision makers, they nonetheless pose threats of job losses for human resources. This in turn pose challenges to human resource managers, tasked with governing the AI adoption processes. However, these challenges afford opportunities to critically examine the various facets of AI systems as they interface with human resources. To that end, we systematically review the literature at the intersection of AI and human resource management (HRM). Using the configurational approach, we identify the evolution of different theme based causal configurations in conceptual and empirical research and the outcomes of AI-HRM interaction. We observe incremental mutations in thematic causal configurations as the literature evolves and also provide thematic configuration based explanations to beneficial and reactionary outcomes in the AI-HRM interaction process.},

The study was based on social cognition theory and a sample of 277 Israeli middle leaders from public elementary and secondary schools. The data were analysed using SPSS and the PROCESS macro. The findings indicate that support for GenAI positively influences both GenAI self-efficacy and valuing but only GenAI self-efficacy emerged as a significant mediator. The results expand the limited empirical scholarship on AI in school leadership, most of which is non-empirical. The results suggest that middle leaders' confidence in their ability to use GenAI plays a critical role in their engagement with the technology and that organisational support helps promote GenAI adoption. Middle leaders' GenAI self-efficacy was shown to play a key role in channelling the beneficial effect of school support on integration in practice. The results and their implications are discussed.},

A new measure (STARA awareness) was created for this study that captures the extent to which employees feel their job could be replaced by these types of technology. Due to career progression and technology knowledge associated with age, we also tested age as a moderator of STARA. Using a mixed-methods approach on 120 employees, we tested STARA awareness on a range of job and well-being outcomes. Greater STARA awareness was negatively related to organisational commitment and career satisfaction, and positively related to turnover intentions, cynicism, and depression.},

More specifically, recent findings of algorithm aversion---the reluctance of human forecasters to use superior but imperfect algorithms---raise questions about whether joint human-algorithm decision making is feasible in practice. In this paper, we systematically review the topic of algorithm aversion as it appears in 61 peer-reviewed articles between 1950 and 2018 and follow its conceptual trail across disciplines. We categorize and report on the proposed causes and solutions of algorithm aversion in five themes: expectations and expertise, decision autonomy, incentivization, cognitive compatibility, and divergent rationalities. Although each of the presented themes addresses distinct features of an algorithmic decision aid, human users of the decision aid, and/or the decision making environment, apparent interdependencies are highlighted. We conclude that resolving algorithm aversion requires an updated research program with an emphasis on theory integration. We provide a number of empirical questions that can be immediately carried forth by the behavioral decision making community.},

  abstract = {Summary             Proactive behavior (self-initiated and future-oriented actions to bring about change) has largely positive consequences for organizationally oriented outcomes such as job performance. Yet the outcomes of proactivity from a well-being perspective have not been clearly considered. Drawing on self-determination theory and the stressor-detachment model, we propose two distinct paths by which proactivity affects individuals' daily well-being. The first path is an energy-generating pathway in which daily proactive behavior enhances end-of-work-day vitality via perceived competence. The second is a strain pathway in which daily proactive behavior generates anxiety at work, which undermines the process of detachment from work. We argue that these pathways are shaped by the extent to which supervisors are prone to blaming employees for their mistakes (punitive supervision). We tested this model using a sample of 94 employees who completed surveys three times a day for between 5 and 7~days. Our multilevel analyses provide support for the proposed dual-pathway model and suggest differential well-being outcomes of daily proactive work behavior. Overall, when an individual behaves proactively at work, they are more likely to experience higher levels of daily perceived competence and vitality. However, these positive effects can exist in parallel with daily negative effects on end-of-workday anxiety, and hence bedtime detachment, but only when the supervisor is perceived to be punitive about mistakes.},

The most critical organizational decisions typically occur through teams. However, team theories are fundamentally psychosocial, and AI disrupts this context by introducing a non-human actor. Therefore, negative implications of AI's role must also be understood. Toward theory on the effective integration of AI into team decision-making, we synthesize the literatures on team effectiveness and team decision-making with research from cognate disciplines on human--technology interaction and teaming. Based on this synthesis, we offer propositions highlighting key variable relationships and negative side effects that must be accounted for in AI--human team decision-making and follow with practical suggestions for management's adaption to this new context. Overall, our analysis emphasizes critical themes, constructs, and relationships valuable for further research aimed at modernizing theory and practice in the face of this emerging technological shift.},

We argue that although popular accounts of AI stress the risks of bias and unfairness, these problems are eminently solvable. However, the way that the AI industry is currently constituted and wider trends in the use of technology for organising work mean that there is a significant risk that AI use will degrade the quality of work. Viewing different scenarios through a paradox lens, we argue that both positive and negative visions of the future are likely to coexist. The HR profession has a degree of agency to shape the future if it chooses to use it; HR professionals need to develop the skills to ensure that ethics and fairness are at the centre of AI development for HR and people management.},

Five hundred fifty-nine persons from South Korea, Russia, Turkey and the United States participated. Results supported the hypothesized relations between autonomy and well-being across cultures and gender. Results also suggested greater internalization of horizontal relative to vertical practices.

Research in work organizations has tended to take the perspectives of either the employees (i.e., their well-being) or the owners (i.e., their profits).

Since spring 2023, the JRC has developed and deployed GPT@JRC, a platform providing safe and compliant access to state-of-the-art Large Language Models for over 10,000 knowledge workers. While the literature highlighting the potential of GenAI to enhance productivity for knowledge-intensive tasks is abundant, there is a scarcity of empirical evidence on impactful use case types and success factors. This study addresses this gap and proposes the JRC GenAI Compass conceptual framework based on the lessons learnt from the JRC's GenAI adoption journey. It includes the concept of AI-IQ, which reflects the complexity of a given GenAI system. This paper thus draws on a case study of enterprise-scale AI implementation in European public institutions to provide approaches to harness GenAI's potential while mitigating the risks.},

Not only has the quality of AI-based agents' outcomes increased, but they can now help proactively, and even take over entire work tasks. However, users need to be satisfied with the system to remain motivated to collaborate and engage with AI-based agents. Drawing on self-determination theory, a vignette-based online experiment was conducted that revealed that proactive (vs. reactive) help from AI-based agents leads to a higher loss of users' competence-based self-esteem and thus reduces users' system satisfaction. This effect is moderated by the users' knowledge of AI. Higher (vs. lower) levels of AI knowledge cause a greater loss of competence-based self-esteem through proactive (vs. reactive) help. The findings contribute to a better understanding of help from AI-based agents and provide important implications for managers and designers who seek to enhance human--AI collaboration.},

  abstract = {Within leadership research, mindfulness is increasingly viewed as being critical for leadership effectiveness. Central to leadership is the ability to support, motivate, and engage followers -- that is, the capacity to have influence. Mindfulness has been proposed as a valuable enabler of effective leadership influence. In this study, we synthesize a growing body of research on mindfulness in leadership contexts by reviewing how and under what conditions mindful leaders influence their followers. We meta-analysed two associations: leaders' mindfulness and leadership behaviours directed towards followers; and leaders' mindfulness and follower outcomes (i.e., well-being, performance and leader--follower relations). Based on a pool of 109 studies with 396 effect sizes and 19,887 participants, we found that leaders with higher mindfulness engage in more follower-centred leadership behaviours, such as more transformational and authentic leadership (r = 0.39 [0.22, 0.54]), and as a result have better relations with followers (r = 0.33 [0.25, 0.40]), and have followers with better well-being (r = 0.33 [0.25, 0.41]) and performance (r = 0.35 [0.29, 0.41]). Longitudinal and emerging intervention evidence corroborates this pattern of findings. Key contributions of this review are critically evaluating the quality of existing studies and outlining a research agenda to advance this field.},

In a three-wave study (               N               Time1               \,=\,401;               N               Time2               \,=\,379;               N               Time3               \,=\,303), we investigated the motivational effects of HR systems that automatically capture---and make decisions based on---employee performance, and whether these effects depend on employee attributions regarding the organization's intended use of its automated HR metric system. Additionally, we test whether these motivational states affect employee task prioritization and emotional exhaustion. Results show that employees whose organizations use algorithmic HR systems, and who also attribute managerial control as intent to that system, experience higher levels of extrinsic motivation at work. This, in turn, predicts greater prioritization of metricized tasks and de-prioritization of non-metricized tasks. Conversely, employees who believe the purpose of algorithmic HR systems is to provide them with constructive feedback are more likely to experience intrinsic motivation, leading to reduced feelings of emotional exhaustion, greater prioritization of metricized tasks, but reduced non-metricized behavior de-prioritization. These results illustrate the critical importance of employee sensemaking around algorithmic HR systems as a precursor to the impact of such systems on employee motivation, behavior, and well-being.},

Among the 259 middle managers represented in the study, managers with formal positions in boundary--spanning sub--units reported higher levels of strategic influence activity than others. At the organizational level of analysis, the study found that firm performance was associated with more uniform levels of downward strategic influence, and more varied levels of upward influence among middle management cohorts. The findings suggest that middle managers' strategic influence arises from their ability to mediate between internal and external selection environments. In addition, positive effects on organizational performance appear to depend on: (1) whether the overall pattern of upward influence is conducive to shifts in the network centrality of individual managers; and (2) whether the pattern of downward influence is consistent with an appropriate balance between the organization's need for control and flexibility.},

We review two contrasting perspectives: agency theory -- which assumes that humans are self-interested rational beings whose actions should be constrained to achieve organizational goals (which are opposing) -- and self-determination theory -- which assumes that individuals will thrive when they have autonomy to pursue activities and can internalize external goals when their needs are satisfied. We highlight how the assumptions of agency theory continue to dominate the design and implementation of management practices and management education, despite decades of evidence that individuals are not solely driven by economic rationality. We suggest that attempts to refine these assumptions have so far fallen short of adequately representing human motivation and highlight an important aspect of self-determination theory which is often neglected from these debates: how people come to internalize goals. Placing motivation internalization as more central to management thinking yields practices that more effectively align the interests of employees and organizations.},

Using self-determination theory, we tested the premise that knowledge sharing and hiding might be differentially motivated and that work design characteristics might influence the motivation to share knowledge with colleagues. In a panel survey of Australian knowledge workers and in a Chinese knowledge-intensive organization, we asked knowledge workers, using time-lagged designs, about perceptions of work design, motivation to share knowledge, and self-reported knowledge sharing and hiding behaviors. Results, largely replicated across both samples, indicated that cognitive job demands and job autonomy were positively related to future reports of knowledge-sharing frequency and usefulness via autonomous motivation to share knowledge. Unexpectedly, task interdependence was positively related to the three forms of knowledge hiding (evasive and rationalized hiding, and playing dumb) via external regulation to share knowledge. Implications for the design of jobs that motivate knowledge sharing and demotivate knowledge hiding are discussed.},

What attention it has received has often taken the form of raising cautions about the potential harmful effects of PFP on (intrinsic) work motivation, as well as on creativity. We critically assess the theory and evidence that have provided the basis for such arguments and conclude that support for such claims (in workplace settings) is lacking. We seek to provide a more accurate view of how extrinsic rewards such as PFP operate in the workplace and how they influence workplace motivation, creativity, and performance. We document how social determination theory and creativity theory have recently undergone major changes that better recognize the potential positive influence of extrinsic rewards such as PFP. Finally, we identify areas in need of further research.},

By using SDT to develop the process-based team motivation emergence model, we describe the role of human psychological needs that are involved in the emergence of this collective construct. An interpersonal feedback loop intertwined with a team process feedback loop predict how team members' individual motivations converge and then transform into team-level motivation through a process of identity construction.

  abstract = {Relationships outside of work impact employee effectiveness at work. But how do we explain this? Our study focuses on the guanxi relationship in China. This is based on close personal ties between supervisors and subordinates initiated outside the workplace. Drawing on conservation of resources theory, we develop a model that explains how supervisor--subordinate guanxi constitutes a social resource that spills over into the workplace and impacts subordinates' job resources (including autonomy, support and development at work), job crafting (proactive behaviors aimed at increasing resources and reducing demands) and job performance (task performance and organizational citizenship behavior). Our model was tested on a sample of 406 subordinates and their supervisors from seven manufacturing organizations in China. The results of a multilevel path analysis indicate that high-quality guanxi relations with supervisors facilitate subordinates' job resources, job crafting behaviors and organizational citizenship behavior at work. In addition, job resources mediate the relationship between supervisor--subordinate guanxi and job crafting, and job crafting mediates the relationship between supervisor--subordinate guanxi and subordinate task performance and organizational citizenship behavior. Overall, our research highlights the importance of externally-generated guanxi between subordinates and supervisors and the mechanisms that contribute to improving employee performance in the workplace.},

But prior research suggests that availability of expertise in teams does not guarantee its use. When are team members more likely to reach out to their peers for their expertise? To answer this question, this paper develops a theoretical model predicting dyadic expertise use in teams based on the opportunity--ability--motivation framework of behavior in organizations. We argue that 3 complementary conditions influence dyadic expertise use in teams: A focal team member is more likely to use a peer's expertise in a specific domain when the peer is perceived to have valuable expertise (opportunity), when the member is psychologically empowered (motivation), and when the member shares a strong tie with the peer (ability). We tested our framework using a 2-wave dataset consisting of 1,898 observations of dyadic domain-specific peer expertise use based on 71 members rating 166 peers nested within 22 teams. Findings suggest that tie strength and psychological empowerment jointly moderate the relationship between perceived peer expertise level and peer expertise use.},

While algorithmic management has been observed primarily within the platform-mediated gig economy, its transformative reach and consequences are also spreading to more standard work settings. Exploring algorithmic management as a sociotechnical concept, which reflects both technological infrastructures and organizational choices, we discuss how algorithmic management may influence existing power and social structures within organizations. We identify three key issues. First, we explore how algorithmic management shapes pre-existing power dynamics between workers and managers. Second, we discuss how algorithmic management demands new roles and competencies while also fostering oppositional attitudes toward algorithms. Third, we explain how algorithmic management impacts knowledge and information exchange within an organization, unpacking the concept of opacity on both a technical and organizational level. We conclude by situating this piece in broader discussions on the future of work, accountability, and identifying future research steps.},

There has been a concomitant increase in scholarship related to AM across scientific domains (e.g., computer science, engineering, operations management, management, sociology, and law). However, this literature is fragmented with scholars disagreeing on the conceptualization and measurement of AM, as well as a lack of consensus on the dimensions of AM influencing various gig worker-related outcomes, the mechanisms through which these influences are exerted, and the relevant boundary conditions. To address these issues, we systematically reviewed the academic literature across scientific disciplines related to the AM of gig workers using natural language processing (NLP)-based topic modeling. Our analysis yielded 12 topics, which we integrate using an input-process-output (IPO) framework to illustrate differing effects of AM on worker-related outcomes. Based on our findings, we provide a comprehensive definition of AM, including its key dimensions, and highlight main mediating pathways through which the individual dimensions of AM impact various gig worker-related outcomes. Finally, we provide a roadmap for future research on AM in the gig economy (GE) using an organizational behavior lens.},

Paradoxically, while the behavior change of organizational members lies at the core of organizational change, theories and models of behavior change are rarely applied to organizational change management. Such knowledge could improve our understanding of underlying psychological mechanisms behind organizational change adoption and maintenance. Using self-determination theory as the framework, we developed a model of organizational change that integrates knowledge across the organizational and behavior change fields by (i) unifying change practices derived from organizational change models and from behavior change techniques, (ii) identifying and unifying underlying psychological mechanisms derived from theories that explain how organizational and behavior change occurs, and (iii) linking change practices to psychological mechanisms. The resulting model aims to provide theoretical and practical guidance for those involved in the planning and implementation of organizational change.},

Emerging evidence shows that presenteeism can be a choice that offers a range of positive benefits to the `presentee' (an employee who works through illness). In this conceptual article, we view presenteeism as purposeful and adaptive behaviour: a dynamic process that serves the purpose of balancing health constraints and performance demands in tandem. We propose a 2\texttimes 2 framework of presenteeism (therapeutic, functional, overachieving, and dysfunctional) and suggest that the success of the presenteeism adaptation process depends on the availability of internal capacities and flexible work resources. When the workplace is supportive and provides adequate resources to aid adaptation, presenteeism can be a sustainable choice for maintaining performance under impaired health. We examine the role of resources for functional presenteeism by drawing on conservation of resources theory and self-determination theory. This framework can contribute to a better understanding of presenteeism by viewing it as an adaptive process, considering presentees as heterogeneous groups, and exploring the importance of internal and work resources for balancing health and performance demands. It sketches new avenues for research and practice and the effective management of presenteeism, health, and performance.},

In spite of its prosocial nature, it is unclear whether and how pro-customer rule breaking also benefits employees who engage in this behavior. Drawing on self-determination theory, we examine employees' well-being and voice at work as outcomes of pro-customer rule breaking. Across a simulation study and a critical incident-based survey study, we found that pro-customer rule breaking was positively related to employee psychological need fulfillment, which, in turn, was associated with lower emotional exhaustion, higher job satisfaction, and increased voice. Furthermore, normative conflict with organizational rule moderated the positive relationship between pro-customer rule breaking and psychological need fulfillment such that employees with high normative conflict with organizational rule (i.e., employee perception that their existing organizational rule results in inefficiency and that their organization could be much better if it changed its practices) benefited more from their pro-customer rule breaking. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings and offer directions for future research.},

Drawing on the automation--augmentation perspective, we propose that AI control over decision-making thwarts human autonomy and thus contributes to stress. Drawing on models of teamwork and augmentation, we expect that human--AI team processes (i.e., transition, action, and interpersonal processes) help people meet their goals and reduce stress. Finally, we argue that human--AI team processes provide an important social resource, which buffers the stress-enhancing role of AI control. To test our hypotheses, we analyzed over 2700 tweets. Using a trained large language model, validated against human ratings, we indexed key measures. Results confirm that high AI control was associated with increased stress, whereas human--AI team processes were associated with decreased stress. In support of the moderation hypothesis, two human--AI team processes (action and interpersonal) helped further reduce the stress-enhancing effect of AI control. We discuss implications for work design theory and the importance of regulating levels of AI control to protect workers' mental health.},

In a synthesis of this literature, we conclude there is good overall evidence, with the most promising evidence at the individual level. Specifically, our systematic review assessed whether top-down work redesign interventions affect performance and, if so, why (mechanisms) and when (boundary conditions). We identified 55 heterogeneous work redesign intervention studies, of which 39 reported a positive effect on performance, two reported a negative effect, and 14 reported mixed effects. Of five types of work redesign, the evidence that work characteristics can explain the effect of redesign interventions on performance was most promising for relational interventions, and participative and non-participative job enrichment and enlargement. Autonomous work group and system-wide interventions showed initial evidence. As to `why' work redesigns enhance performance, we identified change in work motivation, quick response and learning as three core mechanisms. As to `when', we showed that intervention implementation, intervention context (including alignment of organizational systems, processes and the work redesign) and person factors are key boundary conditions. We synthesize our findings into an integrative multilevel model that can be used to design, implement and evaluate work redesigns aimed at improving performance.},

It identifies three families of theoretical perspectives informing research on AI acceptance---user acceptance, delegation acceptance, and societal adoption acceptance. These models differ in scope, each has elements specific to them, and the connotation of technology acceptance thus changes when shifting perspective. The discussion points to a need for combining the three perspectives as they have all become relevant for AI. A combined approach serves to systematically relate findings from different studies. And as AI systems affect people in different constellations and no single perspective can accommodate them all, building blocks from several perspectives are needed to comprehensively study how AI is perceived in society.},

This is particularly evident in financial service industries. Given the significance and rapidity of this technological transition, this case study investigated how middle managers perceived the impacts of AI system integration on their work characteristics. Interview data were gathered from 25 middle managers of a company providing financial services. The data were analyzed using the Gioia method. The findings showed that the AI systems applied in the case company were perceived as technical tools (mechanical AI) or coworkers (thinking AI and feeling AI), which had different impacts on middle managers' work characteristics and the relationship between humans and AI systems. The middle managers' work characteristics included contextual, task, competence, social, and relationship characteristics. Regarding the relationship characteristics, this study shows theoretically distinct human--AI relationship types. The findings are organized into a conceptual framework.

In this paper, we contribute to the literature on WCSE by examining the mechanisms through which it impacts well-being at work and outside of work. We challenge contingent self-esteem (CSE) theory (Crocker \& Park, 2004), which argues that CSE negatively impacts well-being by fostering internally controlled (introjected) motivation and diminishing autonomous motivation, by suggesting that WCSE fosters autonomous and internally controlled motivation and thus has both beneficial and harmful effects on well-being. We also expand CSE theory by suggesting that WCSE can negatively impact well-being outcomes by causing work--nonwork conflict. Results from a time-separated design in a sample of full-time employees supported our arguments, revealing that WCSE impacted well-being at work through both autonomous and internally controlled work motivations. WCSE also had negative effects on well-being at and outside of work through work--nonwork conflict. The beneficial effects of WCSE outweighed its harmful effects on job satisfaction and neutralized its harmful effects for all other outcomes. We discuss theoretical implications for CSE theory, self-determination theory, and work--nonwork issues and note important practical implications.},

Organizational dehumanization (OD), defined as employees' perceptions of being treated as mere tools by their organization, has been shown to negatively affect employees and organizations. To explain such detrimental effects, scholars have argued that OD might thwart employees' fundamental psychological needs. Yet, evidence of this mechanism remains empirically nonexistent. Filling this gap, this research aims at investigating the mediating role of psychological need thwarting in the relationships between OD and employees' well-being and attitudes. Based on a cross-sectional study ( N = 340) and a two-wave study (3 months apart; N = 603), the results indicate that OD thwarts employees' psychological needs which are, in turn, negatively related to their well-being (psychological strains, absenteeism, and job satisfaction) and attitudes (turnover intentions and affective commitment).},

However, there is little empirical evidence establishing the complete SDT mediational process in the HR domain, which entails basic psychological needs and motivation acting as mediators of relations between HR practices and work outcomes. The present study addresses this issue with a mixed methods approach. Using an item classification task with subject matter experts (N = 48), HR practices were classified as autonomy-, competence-, and relatedness-supportive. Based on this scheme, we tested an SDT-based conceptual model in a three-wave sample of working adults (N = 818). Results from Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling (MSEM) support the hypothesized model: basic psychological need satisfaction and autonomous motivation mediate the relationship between HR practice perceptions and work outcomes (performance, thriving, affective organizational commitment, and turnover intentions). Autonomy-supportive practices had a positive effect on autonomy need satisfaction, while competence-supportive practices had positive associations with all three basic psychological needs. Counterintuitively, relatedness-supportive practices had negative effects on autonomy and competence need satisfaction, and the relationship between relatedness-supportive practices and autonomy need satisfaction was moderated by chronological age. We discuss our findings in the context of prominent HR studies that utilize SDT and offer a supplemental age-inclusive HR practice scheme for HR managers interested in understanding the benefits of supporting basic psychological needs from both a motivation and workforce retention standpoint.},

Yet, measuring the quality of knowledge work is challenging, raising the question of how to evaluate AI performance in such contexts. We investigate this question through a field study of a major U.S. hospital, observing how managers evaluated five different machine-learning (ML) based AI tools. Each tool reported high performance according to standard AI accuracy measures, which were based on ground truth labels provided by qualified experts. Trying these tools out in practice, however, revealed that none of them met expectations. Searching for explanations, managers began confronting the high uncertainty of experts' know-what knowledge captured in ground truth labels used to train and validate ML models. In practice, experts address this uncertainty by drawing on rich know-how practices, which were not incorporated into these ML-based tools. Discovering the disconnect between AI's know-what and experts' know-how enabled managers to better understand the risks and benefits of each tool. This study shows dangers of treating ground truth labels used in ML models objectively when the underlying knowledge is uncertain. We outline implications of our study for developing, training, and evaluating AI for knowledge work.},

The very nature of creativity requires self-direction, however. This points to shared leadership, a process in which members dynamically share the leadership role, as a particularly relevant influence to consider. Drawing on psychological empowerment theory, we develop the shared leadership perspective on individual creativity. We argue that shared leadership has a cross-level influence on individual creativity that is mediated by the experience of meaning of work and moderated by individual differences in power distance value: for individuals lower on power distance, shared leadership has a positive linear relationship with individual creativity; for individuals higher on power distance, shared leadership has a curvilinear relationship with individual creativity that is decreasingly positive. Using a sample of 623 members from 95 teams in 34 Chinese organizations, we find support for this multilevel model. Findings offer theoretical implications for shared leadership and creativity research and provide managerial implications.},

However, preceding studies on digital transformation still have the problem of ``seeing things but not people'', ignoring factors at the employee level, which makes the impact of digital transformation on employee resilience remains a subject of debate and investigation. Based on the job-demands resources theory and regulatory focus theory, this study explores the double-edged sword nature of digital transformation by constructing a dual-path model, and examines its potential to both enable and burden employees' resilience. Through the analysis of a 3-wave multisource data from employees in different cities in China (N~=~432), the dual-path model between digital transformation and employee resilience was supported. That is, the mediating effect of thriving at work and job insecurity were confirmed. In addition, the moderating effect of both promotion focus and prevention focus were proved, respectively. From a human-centric perspective, the present study theoretically expands the research of digital transformation in the context of organization. In the meanwhile, this study offers practical insights for organizations seeking to maximize the benefits of digital transformation while minimizing its potential negative consequences on employee resilience.},

This study aimed to explore how employees can positively respond and adapt to digital transformation and the uncertainty it creates. Based on the job demands--resources (JD-R) theory, we propose that perceived technology uncertainty may be a type of job demand which will increase employees' technostress and, sequentially, reduce job satisfaction. Moreover, we argue that two factors, coproduction work context and individual skill flexibility, should be included as additional demands and resources that jointly interact and influence employees' wellbeing. We explore our theoretical arguments in the financial services industry context, where the Fintech Revolution is undergoing. Data from a two-wave survey of 296 employees revealed that perceived technology uncertainty indeed threatens employees' subjective wellbeing through increased technostress. However, we found complex interactions among these three factors. While coproduction was originally an intensive job demand, it becomes a job resource to help employees cope with technostress if they have high skill flexibility. If employees can flexibly use their skills to face digital revolution challenges, the experiences acquired from coproduction jobs will be valuable for future work. Managerial implications were also discussed, along with directions for future research.},

Researchers have applied self-determination theory to identify key motivational correlates of these adaptive work-related determinants and outcomes. Research applying the theory has consistently indicated that autonomous forms of motivation and basic psychological need satisfaction are related to better employee performance, satisfaction, and engagement, while controlled forms of motivation and need frustration are associated with increased employee burnout and turnover. Forms of motivation have also been shown to mediate relations between need satisfaction and adaptive workplace outcomes. Despite support for these associations, a number of limitations in research in the field have been identified, which place limits on the inferences that can be drawn. Noted limitations encompass an over-reliance on single-occasion, correlational data; few fit-for-purpose tests of theory mechanisms; and a lack of consideration of key moderating variables. In the current conceptual review, we discuss these limitations in turn, with specific reference to examples from the extant research applying the theory in workplace contexts, and provide a series of recommendations we expect will set the agenda for future studies applying the theory in the workplace. Based on our review, we make three key recommendations: we stress the need for studies adopting experimental and longitudinal designs to permit better inferences (i.e., causal and directional), highlight the need for intervention research to explicitly test mediation effects to provide evidence for theory mechanisms, and outline some candidate moderators of theory effects, including workplace context, job type, pay structure, and causality orientations. We expect these recommendations to set an agenda for future research applying self-determination theory in workplace contexts with a view to filling the current evidence gaps and improving evidential quality.},

Against tendencies to present algorithmic management as having predetermined, undesired consequences (e.g. restriction of job autonomy, poor financial compensation and deteriorating working conditions), our `duality of algorithmic management' perspective offers two amendments to the dominant thinking on HRM algorithms and their outcomes to workers. First, we showcase how algorithmic management simultaneously restrains and enables autonomy and value to workers -- with the latter referring to both use (i.e. non-monetary benefits) and exchange value (i.e. monetary benefits) that workers derive from working (under algorithmic management). In doing so, we make the case that the desired consequences of HRM algorithms to workers co-exist alongside the undesired consequences that the literature has mostly reported on. Second, we argue that algorithmic management is shaped by, as much as it shaping, the autonomy and value to workers. We do so by highlighting the `recursivity' of algorithmic management that occurs when software designers and/or self-learning algorithms reinforce or limit worker acts for (re)gaining job autonomy and/or creating value out of HRM algorithms. We conclude this paper with the presentation of avenues for future research into the duality of algorithmic management, which sets the stage for a future line of inquiry into the complex interrelationships among HRM algorithms, job autonomy and value.},

However, in practice, the introduction of AI tools often fails to meet these expectations and results in negative consequences, such as worker resistance and dissatisfaction. Yet we have little understanding of the process of how and why initially positive design intentions of AI tools result in negative consequences. Building on a qualitative in-depth case study of a Chinese firm introducing an AI tool in sales, we found that whereas the AI tool's initial design seemingly intended to lead to salespeople's empowerment and first achieved respective outcomes, over time the tool was appropriated for managerial control. We show that this devolution emerged organically from a growing managerial awareness of the affordances that the AI tool offered managers to perform their work better. Our study contributes to the literature on AI by highlighting the potential dangers of AI tools and emphasizing the importance of including workers in the AI tool's design and implementation phases.},

  abstract = {This paper is the first to examine the impact of robotization on work meaningfulness, autonomy, competence, and relatedness, which are essential to motivation and well-being at work. Using surveys of workers and robotization data for 14 industries in 20 European countries spanning 2005--2021, we find a consistent negative impact of robotization on perceived work meaningfulness and autonomy. Using instrumental variables, we find that doubling robotization leads to a 0.9~\% decrease in work meaningfulness and a 1~\% decline in autonomy. To put this in perspective, if the robotization levels of the top 5 industry were to match those of the leading industry in terms of robot adoption in 2020 (equivalent to a 7.5-fold increase), it would result in a decline of 6.8~\% in work meaningfulness and 7.5~\% in autonomy. The link between robotization, competence, and relatedness is also negative but less robust. We also examine how tasks, skills, and socio-demographic characteristics moderate the main relationships. We find that workers with routine tasks experience an even greater negative effect of robotization in terms of declines in their autonomy, competence, and relatedness. However, we also discover that utilizing computers as tools for independent work can help workers maintain a sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in industries and job roles that adopt robots. Our results highlight that by deteriorating work meaningfulness and self-determination, robotization can impact work life above and beyond its consequences for employment and wages.},

GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales.

  abstract = {There is an increasing body of research on algorithmic management (AM), but the field lacks measurement tools to capture workers' experiences of this phenomenon. Based on existing literature, we developed and validated the algorithmic management questionnaire (AMQ) to measure the perceptions of workers regarding their level of exposure to AM. Across three samples (overall n = 1332 gig workers), we show the content, factorial, discriminant, convergent, and predictive validity of the scale. The final 20-item scale assesses workers' perceived level of exposure to algorithmic: monitoring, goal setting, scheduling, performance rating, and compensation. These dimensions formed a higher order construct assessing overall exposure to algorithmic management, which was found to be, as expected, negatively related to the work characteristics of job autonomy and job complexity and, indirectly, to work engagement. Supplementary analyses revealed that perceptions of exposure to AM reflect the objective presence of AM dimensions beyond individual variations in exposure. Overall, the results suggest the suitability of the AMQ to assess workers' perceived exposure to algorithmic management, which paves the way for further research on the impacts of these rapidly accelerating systems.},

While scholars have been examining the impact of AI on workplace outcomes more closely over the past two decades, the literature falls short in providing a holistic scholarly review of this body of research. Such a review is needed in order to: (a) guide future research on the effects of AI on the workplace; and (b) help managers make proper use of AI technology to improve workplace and organizational outcomes. This is the first systematic review to explore the relationship between artificial intelligence and workplace outcomes. Through an exhaustive systematic review and analysis of existing literature, we ultimately examine and cross-relate 60 papers, published in 30 leading international (AJG 3 and 4) journals over a period of 25~years (1995--2020). Our review researches the AI-workplace outcomes nexus by drawing on the major functions of human resource management and the process framework of `antecedents, phenomenon, outcomes' at multiple levels of analysis. We review the sampled articles based on years of publication, theories, methods, and key themes across the `antecedents, phenomenon, outcomes' framework. We provide useful directions for future research by embedding our discussion within HR literature, while we recommend topics drawing on alternative units of analysis and theories that draw on the individual, team, and institutional levels.},

With our opinion piece, we challenge this perspective. Our essay aims to be a wake-up call for large parts of academia and practice that romanticize human leadership and think that this bastion can never be overtaken by AI. We delineate why algorithms will not (need to) come to a halt before core characteristics of leadership and potentially cater better to employees' psychological needs than human leaders. Against this background, conscious choices need to be made about what role humans are to play in the future of leadership. These considerations hold significant implications for the future of not only leadership research but also leadership education and development.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to explain potential psychological effects of algorithmic management (AM) on human-centered task design and with that also workers' mental well-being. For this, we link research on algorithmic management (AM) with Sociomaterial System Theory and Action Regulation Theory (ART). Our main assumption is that psychological effects of sociomaterial systems, such as AM, can be explained by their impact on human action. From the synthesis of the theories, mixed effects on human-centered task design can be derived: It can be expected that AM contributes to fewer action regulation opportunities (i.e., job resources like job autonomy, transparency, predictability), and to lower intellectual demands (i.e., challenge demands like task complexity, problem solving). Moreover, it can be concluded that AM is related with more regulation problems (i.e., hindrance demands like overtaxing regulations) but also fewer regulation problems (like regulation obstacles, uncertainty). Based on these considerations and in line with the majority of current research, it can be assumed that the use of AM is indirectly associated with higher risks to workers' mental well-being. However, we also identify potential positive effects of AM as some stressful and demotivating obstacles at work are often mitigated. Based on these considerations, the main question of future research is not whether AM is good or bad for workers, but rather               how               work under AM can be designed to be humane. Our proposed model can guide and support researchers and practitioners in improving the understanding of the next generation of AM systems.},

Correlations became increasingly positive with the~more internalized forms of work motivation described by self-determination theory. LAS was~positively associated with basic needs, well-being, and positive work behaviors, and was~negatively associated with distress. Correlations were not moderated by the source of LAS, country of the sample, publication status, or the operationalization of autonomy support. In addition, a meta-analytic path analysis supported motivational processes that underlie LAS and its consequences in workplaces. Overall, our findings lend support for autonomy support as a leadership approach that~is consistent with~self-determination and optimal functioning in work settings.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Teams that combine human intelligence with artificial intelligence (AI) have become indispensable for solving complex tasks in various decision-making contexts in modern organizations. However, the factors that contribute to AI convergence, where human team members align their decisions with those of their AI counterparts, still remain unclear. This study integrates signaling theory with self-determination theory to investigate how specific signals---such as signal fit, optional AI advice, and signal set congruence---affect employees' AI convergence in human--AI teams. Based on four experimental studies conducted in facial recognition and hiring contexts with approximately 1100 participants, the findings highlight the significant positive impact of congruent signals from both human and AI team members on AI convergence. Moreover, providing an option for employees to solicit AI advice also enhances AI convergence; when AI signals are chosen by employees rather than forced upon them, participants are more likely to accept AI advice. This research advances knowledge on human--AI teaming by (1) expanding signaling theory into the human--AI team context; (2) developing a deeper understanding of AI convergence and its drivers in human--AI teams; (3) providing actionable insights for designing teams and tasks to optimize decision-making in high-stakes, uncertain environments; and (4) introducing facial recognition as an innovative context for human--AI teaming.},

  abstract = {The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has arrived, as AI systems are increasingly being integrated across organizational functions into the work lives of employees. This coupling of employees and machines fundamentally alters the work-related interactions to which employees are accustomed, as employees find themselves increasingly interacting with, and relying on, AI systems instead of human coworkers. This increased coupling of employees and AI portends a shift toward more of an ``asocial system,'' wherein people may feel socially disconnected at work. Drawing upon the social affiliation model, we develop a model delineating both adaptive and maladaptive consequences of this situation. Specifically, we theorize that the more employees interact with AI in the pursuit of work goals, the more they experience a need for social affiliation (adaptive)---which may contribute to more helping behavior toward coworkers at work---as well as a feeling of loneliness (maladaptive), which then further impair employee well-being after work (i.e., more insomnia and alcohol consumption). In addition, we submit that these effects should be especially pronounced among employees with higher levels of attachment anxiety. Results across four studies (N = 794) with mixed methodologies (i.e., survey study, field experiment, and simulation study; Studies 1--4) with employees from four different regions (i.e., Taiwan, Indonesia, United States, and Malaysia) generally support our hypotheses.

However, this application of AI has provoked much debate. On the one hand, powerful AI data analytics increase the quality of feedback, which may enhance employee productivity (``deployment effect''). On the other hand, employees may develop a negative perception of AI feedback once it is disclosed to them, thus harming their productivity (``disclosure effect''). We examine these two effects theoretically and test them empirically using data from a field experiment. We find strong evidence that both effects coexist, and that the adverse disclosure effect is mitigated by employees' tenure in the firm. These findings offer pivotal implications for management theory, practice, and public policies.},

With the establishment of the field of artificial intelligence (AI) in 1956, humankind moved one step closer to realising this aspiration. Today, AI demonstrates superiority over humans in narrow domains; however, is humanity ready to delegate the uniquely human ability to lead others to AI? This question remains a significant and ongoing debate in the literature. This study examines the transformation of leadership in the AI era in light of this question. The literature review revealed two main themes: AI-supported leadership and AI leadership. AI-supported leadership reflects the widely accepted leadership model in the literature. It is explored under two subdimensions: AI's contributions to leadership roles and the skills and responsibilities of human leaders in the AI era. In contrast, AI leadership, which currently has limited support in the literature, is discussed within the framework of ongoing debates. This study is significant because it examines AI-supported leadership across multiple dimensions and presents current discussions on AI leadership.           ,              \.Insanlar\i{} y\"onlendirmek ve kendi temsilini yaratmak, insanl\i\u g\i n var oldu\u gundan beri vazge\c cemedi\u gi arzular olmu\c stur. 1956 y\i l\i nda yapay zek\^a disiplininin kurulmas\i yla insanl\i k, bu hayaline biraz daha yakla\c sm\i\c st\i r.

To assist future research, the present study aimed to develop and validate a Work-related Basic Need Satisfaction scale (W-BNS). Using four Dutch-speaking samples, evidence was found for the three-factor structure of the scale, the discriminant validity, and the reliability of the three need satisfaction subscales as well as their criterion-related and predictive validity. The W-BNS may therefore be considered as a promising tool for future research and practice.},

To this end, we conducted a meta-analytic review of 99 studies with 119 distinct samples examining the antecedents and consequences of basic need satisfaction.

Furthermore, our analysis shows that progress in the temporal fit domain has been confined by five major obstacles: An emphasis on selection and socialization processes, a narrow focus on the between-person level of analysis, preoccupation with linear change, a strong interest in normal causation questions, and a lack of attention to misfit. We conclude with a discussion of the research challenges that lie ahead and provide suggestions to tackle these challenges and expand temporal PE fit research in new directions.},

In a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top HRM, international business (IB), general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within HRM settings. Results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. The impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on HRM strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot/AI collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and HRM activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance. This study discusses these shifts in detail, along with the main contributions to theory and practice and directions for future research.},

(GIO) the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into work processes and its impact on employee psychological well-being is examined, particularly focusing on the dimensions of positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning and accomplishment as proposed by the PERMA model. Since integrating AI into work processes significantly influences work dynamics, structures and job roles, comprehensive, human-centered work design frameworks are necessary. Existing frameworks to AI integration often prioritize extrinsic factors like productivity and ease of use, overlooking intrinsic factors such as engagement, meaning and emotional support, which are crucial for promoting psychological well-being in dynamic workplace environments. Furthermore, the dual potential of AI to either enhance or undermine psychological well-being underlines the importance of balancing AI's technical advantages with its psychological implications. To address these issues, a~narrative literature review was conducted, synthesizing interdisciplinary studies on the integration of AI into work processes. This review specifically explores the implications of AI on employee psychological well-being through the lens of the PERMA model, providing an extension of the work design framework and insights for designing AI systems that are not only functional but also support a~human-centered and positive workplace environment.},

We first discuss the major themes in the literature based on an input--process--output framework. Specifically, we review what factors drive individuals to engage in gig work, how gig work impacts gig workers based on four theoretical approaches, and what outcomes individuals experience as a result of engaging in gig work. Based on the literature review, we highlight six future research agendas. We also discuss practical implications for gig workers, traditional organizations, digital labor platforms, and society.},

  abstract = {In a series of four online experimental studies (total N\,=\,3,562), we investigated the performance augmentation effect and psychological deprivation effect of human-generative AI (GenAI) collaboration in professional settings. Our findings consistently demonstrated that collaboration with GenAI enhanced immediate task performance. However, this performance augmentation effect did not persist in subsequent tasks performed independently by humans. Importantly, transitioning from collaboration with GenAI to solo work led to an increased sense of control of human workers, and was also accompanied by significant decreases in intrinsic motivation and increases in feelings of boredom. These results highlight the complex dual effects of human-GenAI collaboration: It enhances immediate task performance but can undermine long-term psychological experiences of human workers.},

The researchers examine their findings to offer ways that leaders can redesign workflows and preserve the elements of work that drive intrinsic motivation. By doing so, companies can unlock the full potential of both AI and their workforce.},

Limited information is available on employee work status and performance. We used job demands-resources model to discuss the influence of job characteristics on work engagement through employee work status. Employee work status in DT was defined by alienation and motivation, and the mechanism of job characteristics influence job performance was delineated. We collected 425 valid questionnaires taking Taiwanese hospitality employees as the research object, and conducted path analysis by structural equation modelling. Job demands of service recovery awareness and digital competence at work and job resources of job support, perceived psychological empowerment, and training significantly affect employee alienation and motivation, respectively. Alienation and motivation significantly affect work engagement, and mediate the relationships between job characteristics and work engagement fully. This study proposes specific suggestions for talent training and retention of the hospitality industry in DT era.},

Design/methodology/approach               A three-wave, two-source design was used to collect quantitative data from 301 employees and 45 direct supervisors of mainland Chinese enterprises. Testing the hypotheses was conducted through multiple regression analysis and moderated regression analysis.                                         Findings               Results showed that HL was positively related to employee adaptive performance. Additionally, the relationship between HL and employee adaptive performance was mediated by self-determination. Furthermore, this positive effect of HL on self-determination was minimized among employees who attribute HL to impression management motives but is insignificant for employees who attribute HL to performance improvement motives.                                         Originality/value               It has been widely concerned that the traditional ``top-down'' leadership styles are associated with employee adaptive performance; however, the role of bottom-up leadership styles on employee adaptive performance has only been sporadically examined. The present study introduced HL, a typical bottom-up leadership style and developed a moderated mediation model to investigate the potential effect of HL on employee adaptive performance. Moreover, by confirming the mediating role of self-determination, the authors further uncover how HL facilitates employees' adaptive performance. Meanwhile, the moderating role of employee attributions of HL found in this study offers new insights into the understanding of the effectiveness of HL.},

Results from two studies---a survey study with 259 leader--subordinate dyads and an experimental study with 174 part-time master's-level students---largely supported our theoretical model. First, employees develop harmonious passion when they perceive the presence of a mastery climate, but develop obsessive passion when they perceive the presence of a performance climate. Second, harmonious passion mediates the positive effect of mastery climate on employees' proactive work behavior, whereas obsessive passion mediates the positive effect of performance climate on employees' pro-job unethical behavior. Theoretical contributions and practical implications are also discussed.},

The growing adoption of AI is reshaping organizational workflows and employee experiences, delivering benefits while presenting novel challenges, reflecting a double-edged sword effect. Although prior studies have identified potential impacts of AI usage on employees, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently examined. Guided by self-determination theory, this study investigates the dual pathways---facilitative and inhibitive---by which AI usage impacts employee task performance via motivational and behavioral mechanisms. It further investigates the boundary role of core self-evaluations (CSE) in moderating these effects. Methodology. A three-wave, multi-source field study was conducted involving 409 employee-supervisor pairs from AI-intensive industries in China. Data were collected using leader--employee matched questionnaires. Key constructs---AI usage, motivation types, job crafting, task performance, and CSE---were measured using validated scales. Hypotheses were tested via hierarchical regression, bootstrapping, and moderated mediation analyses using SPSS and Mplus. Findings. Results revealed a dual-chain mediation mechanism: AI usage enhances task performance via autonomous motivation and promotion-focused job crafting, but simultaneously impairs it through controlled motivation and prevention-focused job crafting. Furthermore, CSE significantly moderates both pathways, amplifying the positive and buffering the negative effects. Originality. This study provides understanding of AI usage's ``double-edged sword'' effect by identifying parallel motivational-behavioral pathways and the boundary condition of core self-evaluations. The findings enrich self-determination theory in the digital context and offer actionable insights for designing inclusive and personalized AI integration strategies.},

  abstract = {Digital transformation elicits new management challenges. Studies have investigated its direct impact on employee behavior, but how employees evaluate enterprise digital capability, and its underlying mechanism remains unknown. Employees' evaluations of enterprise digital capability tend to shape their subsequent attitudinal and behavioral responses towards the digital transformation, which may ultimately stress influence on the overall transformation initiative in a ``bottom-up'' manner. Drawing from work design theory and conservation of resources theory, this study proposes that through the implementation of effective work design strategies, organizations can foster a sense of employee impact, and further construes a mediated moderation model regarding how the relationship between employee impact and their evaluation of enterprise digital capability is moderated by empowering leadership, and further, mediated by cognitive adjustment at work. Empirical results based on a three-wave survey featuring 424 full-time Chinese employees show that: employee impact predicts evaluation of enterprise digital capability, and such linkage is not only enhanced by empowering leadership but also strengthened by cognitive adjustment at work. The moderation effect of empowering leadership in the relationship between impact and digital capability evaluation is further mediated by cognitive adjustment at work. We explore the antecedents and mechanisms of differences in employees' evaluation of enterprise digital capability and propose takeaway managerial messages.},
